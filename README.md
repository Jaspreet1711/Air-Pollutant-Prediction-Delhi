## I. Problem Statement
Delhi is struggling with pollution and bad air quality from past many years. People with respiratory issues face many health problems. If we are able to forecast and predict pollution level government and patients can take precautionary measures early. PM2.5 and PM10 are major pollutants present that are hazardous to health.

## II. Data Science Problem
Data science can help in Forecasting of PM2.5 but no structured time series data is available for Delhi. Weather condition play crucial role in pollution level but again no structured data is available. To Forecast with accuracy we need good quality data in regular time series and need to understand multiple factors (features) impacting PM2.5 (Lable-1) and PM10 (lable-2). To understand label independency on features we can do a cross section analysis by using statistical techniques and machine learning.   

## III. Data Collection

A. Air Quality Index (AQI) Data
       Day wise AQI Level for every hour at different DPCC Stations of Delhi.   
       Technique: Web Scraping (Using Selenium in Python)
