Time Series Forecasting and Cross Section Prediction of PM2.5 and PM10 in Delhi

## Problem
Delhi is struggling with pollution and bad air quality from past many years and people with respiratory issues face many health problems. If we are able to forecast and predict pollution level government and patients can take precautionary measures early. PM2.5 and PM10 are major pollutants present that are hazardous to health.

## Data Science Problem
Data science can help in Forecasting of PM2.5 but no structured time series data is available for delhi. Weather condition play crucial role in pollution level but again no structured data is available. To Forecast with accuracy we need good quality data in regular time series and need to understand multiple factors (features) impacting PM2.5 (Lable-1) and PM10 (lable-2). To understand label independency on features we can do a cross section analysis by using statistical techniques and machine learning.
